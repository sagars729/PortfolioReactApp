			"description": "I was an SDE 1 intern for the Amazon Associates team. I developed and owned an end-to-end recommendation system for matching brands with content creators. To accomplish this I created an ML recommender model and deployed it using AWS and Amazon's internal tools and services. I built a pipeline to automate data preprocessing and model training, evaluation, and prediction. I also authored a design document that detailed my research findings, proposed architecture, results, and next steps.\nThroughout this internship, I learned how to work with multiple AWS Services such as Sagemaker, S3, EMR, ECR, CloudFormation, and IAM. I also took multiple courses through Amazon's Machine Learning University to expand my ML skills.",

We created a ReactJS Web App that was hosted on AWS using S3, Lambda, add DynamoDB.\nOver the summer, I worked with the CyberML team to develop anomaly detection models for network traffic using Machine Learning. We created models from the ground up - starting with an initial research stage and ending with developed proof of concept models that are being carried forward by the CyberML team. These models will help Capital One identify new and existing threats on their network perimeter.\nI have also gained experience working with Agile Methodology and had the opportunity to use Capital One's Tech Invest In Yourself Days to gain skills in AWS and Unsupervised Learning.",
